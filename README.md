# Technical Engagement Quickstart

This project is designed to give structured help when designing solutions on Azure with partners.

It should be used as a reference by solution architects when engaging on a new project to accelerate and improve the quality of the engagement by applying a proven set of practices.

This project started as a collection of knowledge from Cloud Solution Architects at Microsoft UK who specialise in building technical solutions with partners, but has now organically grown into an open and collaborative repository of knowledge.

We are always looking to learn, grow and improve so contributions are very welcome. If you find a better way of working or a missing question that's not asked then please submit a change to this repository, no matter how small you believe it may be, it will be valued.


## Contributing


As stated above, we really are looking for others to also contribute their time and knowledge to help improve the overall ecosystem and there are some guidelines you must agree to.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
